Simple and lazy invert color script that can be used anywhere. Codes other than scripts/content.js are (partly) from chrome tutorial with some modification. 
This one also inverts image and background image. If this feature is not needed go to https://github.com/lvsl123/chrome-extension-invert-color-2

So far this one works on most sites but not all of them. Especially sites that uses background images.

I can't guarantee anything else here and this is not completely bug free. If this one does not work on one page I use the other one above.
